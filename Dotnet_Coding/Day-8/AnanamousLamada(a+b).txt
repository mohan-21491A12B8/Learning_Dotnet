C# Program Explanation

"Lambda Expression with Delegate Example"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of a delegate with a lambda expression to perform a simple addition operation.

Code:

using System;

// Delegate declaration for methods that take two integers and return an integer
public delegate int show(int x, int y);

class Program // Class definition
{
    static void Main() // Entry point of the program
    {
        // Lambda expression to define the addition operation
        show s1 = (a, b) => a + b;

        // Invoke the delegate with two integers
        int result = s1(23, 12);
        Console.WriteLine(result); // Output the result of the addition
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `public delegate int show(int x, int y);`
   - This line declares a delegate named `show` that can point to any method that takes two integers as parameters and returns an integer.

3. `class Program`
   - This line defines a class named `Program`.

4. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `show s1 = (a, b) => a + b;`
   - This line creates an instance of the `show` delegate and assigns it a lambda expression that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

6. `int result = s1(23, 12);`
   - This line invokes the delegate `s1` with the arguments 23 and 12, and stores the result of the addition in the variable `result`.

7. `Console.WriteLine(result);`
   - This line outputs the value of `result`, which is the sum of 23 and 12.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of a delegate with a lambda expression to perform a simple addition operation. The program defines a delegate named `show`, assigns a lambda expression to it that adds two integers, and then invokes the delegate with specific values. When executed, the program will output:

Represents the result of adding 23 and 12.
