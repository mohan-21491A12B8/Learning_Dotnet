C# Program Explanation

"Try-Finally Example"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of a `try` block and a `finally` block to handle exceptions and ensure cleanup operations.

Code:

using System;

class TryFinallyExample // Class definition
{
    static void Main() // Entry point of the program
    {
        try
        {
            Console.Write("Enter a number: "); // Prompt user for input
            int num = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); // Read and parse the number from user input
            int result = 10 / num; // Attempt to divide 10 by the input number
            Console.WriteLine("Result: " + result); // Display the result of the division
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Finally block executed. Cleaning up resources..."); // Cleanup message
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `class TryFinallyExample`
   - This line defines a class named `TryFinallyExample`.

3. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

4. `try` Block
   - The `try` block contains code that may throw exceptions. In this case, it prompts the user for a number and attempts to parse it.

5. `Console.Write("Enter a number: ");`
   - This line prompts the user to enter a number.

6. `int num = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());`
   - This line reads the user input and attempts to parse it as an integer. If the input is not a valid integer, a `FormatException` may be thrown.

7. `int result = 10 / num;`
   - This line attempts to divide 10 by the input number. If the user enters 0, a `DivideByZeroException` will be thrown.

8. `Console.WriteLine("Result: " + result);`
   - If no exceptions occur, this line outputs the result of the division.

9. `finally` Block
   - The `finally` block is executed after the `try` block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown. It is used for cleanup operations.

10. `Console.WriteLine("Finally block executed. Cleaning up resources...");`
    - This line outputs a message indicating that the `finally` block has been executed, which is useful for resource management or cleanup tasks.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of a `try` block to handle potential exceptions when parsing user input and performing a division operation. The `finally` block ensures that a cleanup message is displayed regardless of whether an exception occurred. 

When executed, if the user enters a valid number, the program will output:
Result: [Result of the division] Finally block executed. Cleaning up resources...

If the user enters an invalid number or zero, the program will throw an exception, but the `finally` block will still execute, displaying:
Finally block executed. Cleaning up resources...

so,this structure helps maintain program stability and ensures that necessary cleanup actions are taken.
