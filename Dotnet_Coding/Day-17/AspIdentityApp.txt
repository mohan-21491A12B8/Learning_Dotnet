Today I created a demo project on ASP.NET Core-Security - Authentication Options, Identity.

Here I'm uploading this project zip file

To run this project,extract the AspIdentityApp.zip file from the Repository then open the file in the Visual Studio Community.

In this AspIdentityApp.zip file,i have learned the basics and created the project using ASP.NET Core-Security - Authentication Options, Identity and
sucessfully run,and tested register/login/logout in the project.
