"Using LINQ to Filter a List of Strings in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to filter a list of strings based on a specific condition.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Lin1
{
    // Main method - entry point of the program
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a list of strings
        List<string> n1 = new List<string> { "arm", "mohan", "sai", "qis" };

        // Use LINQ to filter names that start with the letter 'a'
        var s = from name in n1
                where name.StartsWith("a")
                select name;

        // Print the filtered names
        foreach (var item in s)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Generic;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which provides classes for defining generic collections.

3. `using System.Linq;`
   - This line includes the System.Linq namespace, which provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language Integrated Query (LINQ).

4. `class Lin1`
   - This line defines a class named `Lin1`.

5. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

6. `List<string> n1 = new List<string> { ... };`
   - This line creates a list of strings, initializing it with four names: "arm", "mohan", "sai", and "qis".

7. `var s = from name in n1 ...`
   - This line uses LINQ to filter the list `n1`, selecting names that start with the letter 'a'.

8. `where name.StartsWith("a")`
   - This condition checks if each name in the list starts with the letter 'a'.

9. `select name;`
   - This line specifies that the filtered names should be selected.

10. `foreach (var item in s) { ... }`
    - This loop iterates through the filtered results and prints each item.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of LINQ to filter a list of strings based on a specific condition. It creates a list of names, filters those that start with the letter 'a', and prints the matching names.

When executed, the output will be:
arm

This output shows the names from the list that start with the letter 'a'.
