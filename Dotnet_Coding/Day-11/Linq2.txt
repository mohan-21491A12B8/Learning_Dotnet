"Using LINQ to Filter a List in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to filter a list of objects based on a condition.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    // Main method - entry point of the program
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a list of Person objects
        var s1 = new List<Person>
        {
            new Person { Name = "ram", Age = 34 },
            new Person { Name = "ravi", Age = 32 },
            new Person { Name = "raju", Age = 35 },
            new Person { Name = "raghu", Age = 36 },
        };

        // Use LINQ to filter persons with Age less than 35
        var result = from person in s1
                     where person.Age < 35
                     select new { person.Name, person.Age };

        // Iterate through the filtered results and print them
        foreach (var item in result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
    }

    // Class Person with properties Name and Age
    class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } // Property for person's name
        public int Age { get; set; }      // Property for person's age
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Generic;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which provides classes for defining generic collections.

3. `using System.Linq;`
   - This line includes the System.Linq namespace, which provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language Integrated Query (LINQ).

4. `class Program`
   - This line defines a class named `Program`.

5. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

6. `var s1 = new List<Person> { ... };`
   - This line creates a list of `Person` objects, initializing it with four instances of `Person` with names and ages.

7. `var result = from person in s1 ...`
   - This line uses LINQ to filter the list `s1`, selecting persons whose age is less than 35.

8. `select new { person.Name, person.Age };`
   - This line creates an anonymous type containing the `Name` and `Age` of the filtered persons.

9. `foreach (var item in result) { ... }`
   - This loop iterates through the filtered results and prints each item.

10. `class Person`
    - This line defines a class named `Person`.

11. `public string Name { get; set; }`
    - This line defines a property `Name` of type string for the `Person` class.

12. `public int Age { get; set; }`
    - This line defines a property `Age` of type int for the `Person` class.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of LINQ to filter a list of `Person` objects based on their age. It creates a list of persons, filters those with an age less than 35, and prints their names and ages.

When executed, the output will be:
{ Name = ram, Age = 34 } { Name = ravi, Age = 32 }
This output shows the names and ages of the persons who meet the filtering criteria.
