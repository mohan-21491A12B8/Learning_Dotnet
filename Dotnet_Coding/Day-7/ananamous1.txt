C# Program Explanation

"Anonymous Method Example"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of an anonymous method with a delegate.

Code:

using System;

class c1 // Class definition
{
    public delegate void show(string str); // Delegate declaration for show

    static void Main(string[] args) // Entry point of the program
    {
        string s3 = "information technology"; // String variable to hold information

        // Anonymous method assigned to delegate show
        show s1 = delegate(string s4) 
        {
            Console.WriteLine(s4); // Output the parameter passed to the anonymous method
            Console.WriteLine(s3); // Output the value of s3
        };

        s1("Mohan"); // Call the anonymous method with "Mohan" as the argument
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line is a directive that tells the compiler to include the System namespace. The System namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly used types, such as strings, dates, and console input/output.

2. `class c1`
   - This line defines a class named `c1`.

3. `public delegate void show(string str);`
   - This line declares a delegate named `show` that can point to any method that takes a string parameter and returns void.

4. `static void Main(string[] args)`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program. When the program is executed, the code inside the `Main` method is the first to run.

5. `string s3 = "information technology";`
   - This line initializes a string variable `s3` with the value "information technology".

6. `show s1 = delegate(string s4)`
   - This line creates an instance of the `show` delegate and assigns an anonymous method to it. The anonymous method takes a string parameter `s4`.

7. `Console.WriteLine(s4);`
   - This line outputs the value of the parameter `s4` passed to the anonymous method.

8. `Console.WriteLine(s3);`
   - This line outputs the value of the variable `s3`, which is accessible within the anonymous method.

9. `s1("Mohan");`
   - This line calls the anonymous method assigned to the `s1` delegate, passing "Mohan" as the argument. The output will be:
     ```
     Mohan
     information technology
     ```

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of an anonymous method with a delegate. The program defines a delegate named `show` and assigns an anonymous method to it. This anonymous method outputs the value of its parameter and a string variable `s3`. When executed, the program will output:


The result of calling the anonymous method with the argument "Mohan".
