C# Program Explanation

"Delegates Example"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of delegates to perform addition and subtraction operations.

Code:

using System;

class Cse1 // Class definition
{
    // Delegate declaration for addition
    public delegate void addnum(int a, int b);
    // Delegate declaration for subtraction
    public delegate void subnum(int a, int b);

    // Method to perform addition
    public void Add(int a, int b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Addition of two numbers is : " + (a + b)); // Output the result of addition
    }

    // Method to perform subtraction
    public void Sub(int a, int b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Subtraction of two numbers is : " + (a - b)); // Output the result of subtraction
    }

    static void Main(string[] args) // Entry point of the program
    {
        Cse1 c1 = new Cse1(); // Create an instance of the Cse1 class
        addnum a1 = new addnum(c1.Add); // Create a delegate instance for addition
        subnum s1 = new subnum(c1.Sub); // Create a delegate instance for subtraction

        a1(10, 20); // Call the Add method through the delegate
        s1(10, 5);  // Call the Sub method through the delegate
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `class Cse1`
   - This line defines a class named `Cse1`.

3. `public delegate void addnum(int a, int b);`
   - This line declares a delegate named `addnum` that can point to any method that takes two integers as parameters and returns void.

4. `public delegate void subnum(int a, int b);`
   - This line declares another delegate named `subnum`, similar to `addnum`.

5. `public void Add(int a, int b)`
   - This method takes two integers as parameters and outputs their sum.

6. `public void Sub(int a, int b)`
   - This method takes two integers as parameters and outputs their difference.

7. `static void Main(string[] args)`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

8. `Cse1 c1 = new Cse1();`
   - This line creates an instance of the `Cse1` class.

9. `addnum a1 = new addnum(c1.Add);`
   - This line creates an instance of the `addnum` delegate and associates it with the `Add` method of the `Cse1` instance.

10. `subnum s1 = new subnum(c1.Sub);`
    - This line creates an instance of the `subnum` delegate and associates it with the `Sub` method of the `Cse1` instance.

11. `a1(10, 20);`
    - This line calls the `Add` method through the `a1` delegate, passing 10 and 20 as arguments. The output will be:
      ```
      Addition of two numbers is : 30
      ```

12. `s1(10, 5);`
    - This line calls the `Sub` method through the `s1` delegate, passing 10 and 5 as arguments. The output will be:
      ```
      Subtraction of two numbers is : 5
      ```

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of delegates to encapsulate methods for performing addition and subtraction. The program defines two delegates, `addnum` and `subnum`, and associates them with the `Add` and `Sub` methods, respectively. When executed, the program will output:

The results of the addition and subtraction operations performed through the delegates.
