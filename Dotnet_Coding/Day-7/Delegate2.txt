C# Program Explanation

"Anonymous Method with Delegate Example"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of an anonymous method with a delegate.

Code:

using System;

class Cse2 // Class definition
{
    // Delegate declaration for showing a string
    public delegate void Show(string str);

    static void Main(string[] args) // Entry point of the program
    {
        string s3 = "ram"; // String variable to hold a value

        // Anonymous method assigned to delegate Show
        Show s1 = delegate(string s2) 
        {
            Console.WriteLine(s2); // Output the parameter passed to the anonymous method
        };

        s1("mohan"); // Call the anonymous method with "mohan" as the argument
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `class Cse2`
   - This line defines a class named `Cse2`.

3. `public delegate void Show(string str);`
   - This line declares a delegate named `Show` that can point to any method that takes a string parameter and returns void.

4. `static void Main(string[] args)`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `string s3 = "ram";`
   - This line initializes a string variable `s3` with the value "ram". Note that `s3` is not used in the program.

6. `Show s1 = delegate(string s2)`
   - This line creates an instance of the `Show` delegate and assigns an anonymous method to it. The anonymous method takes a string parameter `s2`.

7. `Console.WriteLine(s2);`
   - This line outputs the value of the parameter `s2` passed to the anonymous method.

8. `s1("mohan");`
   - This line calls the anonymous method assigned to the `s1` delegate, passing "mohan" as the argument. The output will be:
     ```
     mohan
     ```

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of an anonymous method with a delegate. The program defines a delegate named `Show` and assigns an anonymous method to it that outputs the value of its parameter. When executed, the program will output:

The result of calling the anonymous method with the argument "mohan".
