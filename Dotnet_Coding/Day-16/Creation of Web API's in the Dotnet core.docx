EmployeeAdminPortal

Today I created a demo Web API's project on EmployeeAdminPortal.

Here I'm uploading this project zip file

To run this project,extract the Repository EmployeeAdminPortal.zip file then open in the Visual Studio Community.

In this EmployeeAdminPortal.zip file,i have learned the basics and created the project using Web API’s and
tested using the swagger and some online Guid generators in the project.
