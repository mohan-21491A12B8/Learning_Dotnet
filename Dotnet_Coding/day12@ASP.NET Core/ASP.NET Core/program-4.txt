"Deleting a Table from SQL Server Database Using C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates how to delete a table from a SQL Server database using the `SqlConnection` and `SqlCommand` classes.

Code:

using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            new Program().DeleteTable(); // Call the DeleteTable method
        }

        public void DeleteTable()
        {
            SqlConnection conn = null; // Initialize SqlConnection
            try
            {
                // Create a new SqlConnection with the connection string
                conn = new SqlConnection("Data Source=QIS-MOHANSAI\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=mohan;Integrated Security=True");
                
                // Create a SqlCommand to drop the table if it exists
                SqlCommand s1 = new SqlCommand("drop table if exists Mohan", conn);
                
                conn.Open(); // Open the database connection
                
                s1.ExecuteNonQuery(); // Execute the command to drop the table
                Console.WriteLine("Table deleted successfully."); // Success message
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); // Print any error messages
            }
            finally
            {
                if (conn != null && conn.State == System.Data.ConnectionState.Open)
                {
                    conn.Close(); // Close the connection if it is open
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Data.SqlClient;`
   - This line includes the SqlClient namespace, which provides classes for accessing SQL Server databases.

3. `namespace ConsoleApp2`
   - This line defines a namespace for the application.

4. `internal class Program`
   - This line defines a class named `Program`. The `internal` modifier means that this class is accessible only within the same assembly.

5. `static void Main(string[] args)`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

6. `new Program().DeleteTable();`
   - This line creates an instance of the `Program` class and calls the `DeleteTable` method.

7. `public void DeleteTable()`
   - This line defines a public method named `DeleteTable` that will delete a table from the database.

8. `SqlConnection conn = null;`
   - This line initializes a `SqlConnection` object to null.

9. `conn = new SqlConnection("Data Source=...");`
   - This line creates a new instance of `SqlConnection` with the specified connection string, which includes the data source, initial catalog (database name), and security settings.

10. `SqlCommand s1 = new SqlCommand("drop table if exists Mohan", conn);`
    - This line creates a new `SqlCommand` object with a SQL statement to drop the `Mohan` table if it exists.

11. `conn.Open();`
    - This line opens the database connection.

12. `s1.ExecuteNonQuery();`
    - This line executes the SQL command to drop the table. `ExecuteNonQuery` is used for commands that do not return any data.

13. `Console.WriteLine("Table deleted successfully.");`
    - This line prints a success message to the console.

14. `catch (Exception ex) { ... }`
    - This block catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the code and prints the error message.

15. `finally { ... }`
    - This block ensures that the connection is closed if it was opened, regardless of whether an exception occurred.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to delete a table from a SQL Server database using the `SqlConnection` and `SqlCommand` classes. It establishes a connection to the database, executes a command to drop the table, and handles any potential errors.

When executed, the output will be:
Table deleted sucessfully.

If there is an error, the output will be:
Error: [Error message]
