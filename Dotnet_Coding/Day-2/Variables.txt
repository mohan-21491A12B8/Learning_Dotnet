C# Program Explanation

"Variables" Demonstration

This document explains a simple C# program that demonstrates the use of instance variables, static variables, constants, readonly variables, and local variables.

Code:

using System;

namespace Variables
{
    class Variables
    {
        int x = 10, y = 12; // instance variables
        static int p = 33, q = 44; // static variables
        const int a = 13; // constant
        readonly int b = 9; // readonly variable

        void add()
        {
            int i = 1; // local variable
            Console.WriteLine(i);
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Variables v = new Variables(); // Create an instance of Variables
            Console.WriteLine(v.x + v.y); // Access instance variables
            Console.WriteLine(p - q); // Access static variables
            Console.WriteLine(a); // Access constant
            Console.WriteLine(v.b); // Access readonly variable through instance
            
            v.add(); // Call the add method on the instance
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line is a directive that tells the compiler to include the System namespace. The System namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly used types, such as strings, dates, and console input/output.

2. `namespace Variables`
   - This line defines a namespace called `Variables`. Namespaces are used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts. They allow you to group related classes and other types together.

3. `class Variables`
   - This line defines a new class named `Variables`. In C#, every program must have at least one class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects and can contain methods, properties, and other members.

4. `int x = 10, y = 12; // instance variables`
   - These are instance variables, which are specific to an instance of the class. Each object of the `Variables` class will have its own copy of `x` and `y`.

5. `static int p = 33, q = 44; // static variables`
   - These are static variables, which belong to the class itself rather than any specific instance. There is only one copy of `p` and `q`, shared among all instances of the class.

6. `const int a = 13; // constant`
   - This line defines a constant variable `a`, which cannot be changed after it is initialized. It is a compile-time constant.

7. `readonly int b = 9; // readonly variable`
   - This line defines a readonly variable `b`, which can only be assigned a value during declaration or in the constructor of the class. Once assigned, its value cannot be changed.

8. `void add()`
   - This line defines a method named `add`. This method does not return any value and is used to demonstrate local variables.

9. `int i = 1; // local variable`
   - This line declares a local variable `i` within the `add` method. Local variables are only accessible within the method they are defined in.

10. `Console.WriteLine(i);`
    - This line outputs the value of the local variable `i` to the console.

11. `static void Main(string[] args)`
    - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program. When the program is executed, the code inside the `Main` method is the first to run.

12. `Variables v = new Variables();`
    - This line creates an instance of the `Variables` class, allowing access to its instance variables and methods.

13. `Console.WriteLine(v.x + v.y);`
    - This line outputs the sum of the instance variables `x` and `y` to the console.

14. `Console.WriteLine(p - q);`
    - This line outputs the result of subtracting the static variable `q` from the static variable `p`.

15. `Console.WriteLine(a);`
    - This line outputs the value of the constant variable `a`.

16. `Console.WriteLine(v.b);`
    - This line outputs the value of the readonly variable `b` through the instance `v`.

17. `v.add();`
    - This line calls the `add` method on the instance `v`, which outputs the value of the local variable `i`.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of different types of variables, including instance variables, static variables, constants, readonly variables, and local variables. It shows how to create an instance of a class, access its instance variables, and call its methods. The program outputs the results of various operations to
