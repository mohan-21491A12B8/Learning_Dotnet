C# Program Explanation

"Lambda Expression Example"

This document explains a simple C# program that demonstrates the use of a lambda expression with the `Func` delegate to calculate the square of a number.

Code:

using System;

public class lambda
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Func<int, int> square = x => x * x; // Lambda expression to calculate the square
        int result = square(5); // Call the lambda expression with the argument 5
        Console.WriteLine(result); // Output the result
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line is a directive that tells the compiler to include the System namespace. The System namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly used types, such as strings, dates, and console input/output.

2. `public class lambda`
   - This line defines a new public class named `lambda`. In C#, every program must have at least one class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects and can contain methods, properties, and other members.

3. `{`
   - This curly brace indicates the beginning of the class body. All the code that belongs to the `lambda` class will be enclosed within these braces.

4. `public static void Main(string[] args)`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program. When the program is executed, the code inside the `Main` method is the first to run.
   - `public` means that this method can be accessed from other classes.
   - `static` means that this method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.
   - `void` indicates that this method does not return any value.
   - `string[] args` is an array of strings that can hold command-line arguments passed to the program when it is executed.

5. `{`
   - This curly brace indicates the beginning of the `Main` method body. All the code that belongs to the `Main` method will be enclosed within these braces.

6. `Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;`
   - This line declares a `Func` delegate named `square`. The `Func` delegate represents a method that takes one parameter of type `int` and returns a value of type `int`.
   - The lambda expression `x => x * x` defines the logic for the delegate, which calculates the square of the input `x`.

7. `int result = square(5);`
   - This line calls the `square` delegate with the argument `5`. The lambda expression executes, calculating the square of `5`, which is `25`, and assigns the result to the variable `result`.

8. `Console.WriteLine(result);`
   - This line outputs the value of `result` to the console. In this case, it will print `25`.

9. `}`
   - This curly brace indicates the end of the `Main` method.

10. `}`
    - This curly brace indicates the end of the `lambda` class.

Summary:
This simple C# program demonstrates the use of a lambda expression with the `Func` delegate to calculate the square of a number. The program defines a lambda expression that takes an integer as input and returns its square. When executed, the program calls this lambda expression with the value `5`, resulting in an output of `25`. This example illustrates the power and simplicity of using lambda expressions for concise function definitions in C#.
