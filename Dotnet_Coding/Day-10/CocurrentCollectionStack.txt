C# Program Explanation

"Using ConcurrentStack in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the creation and usage of a `ConcurrentStack` to store integers in a thread-safe manner, allowing for concurrent additions and removals.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Temp
{
    static void Main()
    {
        ConcurrentStack<int> c1 = new ConcurrentStack<int>(); // Create a new ConcurrentStack

        // Parallel loop to push elements onto the stack
        Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>
        {
            c1.Push(i); // Push the current index onto the stack
            Console.WriteLine(i); // Print the current index
        });

        Console.WriteLine("Pop elements:");
        // Pop elements from the stack
        while (c1.TryPop(out int result))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(result); // Print the popped element
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Concurrent;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Concurrent namespace, which contains classes for concurrent collections, including ConcurrentStack.

3. `using System.Threading.Tasks;`
   - This line includes the System.Threading.Tasks namespace, which provides classes for parallel programming.

4. `class Temp`
   - This line defines a class named `Temp`.

5. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

6. `ConcurrentStack<int> c1 = new ConcurrentStack<int>();`
   - This line initializes a new `ConcurrentStack` that will store integers.

7. `Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>`
   - This line starts a parallel loop that iterates from 0 to 9, allowing multiple threads to execute the loop body concurrently.

8. `c1.Push(i);`
   - This line pushes the current index `i` onto the `ConcurrentStack`.

9. `Console.WriteLine(i);`
   - This line prints the current index `i` to the console.

10. `Console.WriteLine("Pop elements:");`
    - This line prints a message indicating that the program will now pop elements from the stack.

11. `while (c1.TryPop(out int result))`
    - This line attempts to pop an element from the stack. If successful, it assigns the popped value to `result`.

12. `Console.WriteLine(result);`
    - This line prints the popped element to the console.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a `ConcurrentStack`, push elements concurrently, and pop elements in a thread-safe manner. The program initializes a `ConcurrentStack` with integers, performs parallel additions, and displays the popped elements at the end.

When executed, the program will output something similar to:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Pop elements: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

The indices being pushed onto the stack by different threads and then the elements being popped in reverse order, demonstrating the LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior of the `ConcurrentStack`.
