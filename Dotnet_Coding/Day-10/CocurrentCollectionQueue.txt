C# Program Explanation

"Using ConcurrentQueue in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the creation and usage of a `ConcurrentQueue` to store integers in a thread-safe manner, allowing for concurrent additions and removals.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Temp
{
    static void Main()
    {
        ConcurrentQueue<int> c1 = new ConcurrentQueue<int>(); // Create a new ConcurrentQueue

        // Parallel loop to enqueue elements
        Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>
        {
            c1.Enqueue(i); // Enqueue the current index
            Console.WriteLine(i); // Print the current index
        });

        Console.WriteLine("Dequeue elements:");
        // Dequeue elements from the queue
        while (c1.TryDequeue(out int result))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(result); // Print the dequeued element
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Concurrent;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Concurrent namespace, which contains classes for concurrent collections, including ConcurrentQueue.

3. `using System.Threading.Tasks;`
   - This line includes the System.Threading.Tasks namespace, which provides classes for parallel programming.

4. `class Temp`
   - This line defines a class named `Temp`.

5. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

6. `ConcurrentQueue<int> c1 = new ConcurrentQueue<int>();`
   - This line initializes a new `ConcurrentQueue` that will store integers.

7. `Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>`
   - This line starts a parallel loop that iterates from 0 to 9, allowing multiple threads to execute the loop body concurrently.

8. `c1.Enqueue(i);`
   - This line enqueues the current index `i` into the `ConcurrentQueue`.

9. `Console.WriteLine(i);`
   - This line prints the current index `i` to the console.

10. `Console.WriteLine("Dequeue elements:");`
    - This line prints a message indicating that the program will now dequeue elements from the queue.

11. `while (c1.TryDequeue(out int result))`
    - This line attempts to dequeue an element from the queue. If successful, it assigns the dequeued value to `result`.

12. `Console.WriteLine(result);`
    - This line prints the dequeued element to the console.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a `ConcurrentQueue`, enqueue elements concurrently, and dequeue elements in a thread-safe manner. The program initializes a `ConcurrentQueue` with integers, performs parallel additions, and displays the dequeued elements at the end.

When executed, the program will output something similar to:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Dequeue elements: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

The indices being enqueued by different threads and then the elements being dequeued in the order they were added, demonstrating the FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior of the `ConcurrentQueue`.
