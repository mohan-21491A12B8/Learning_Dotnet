"Using Methods and Loops in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the use of methods and loops to print messages to the console.

Code:

using System;

class Temp2
{
    // Method M1 that prints "M1" six times
    static void M1()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("M1"); // Print "M1" to the console
        }
    }

    // Method M2 that prints "M2" six times
    static void M2()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("M2"); // Print "M2" to the console
        }
    }

    // Method M3 that prints "M3" six times
    static void M3()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("M3"); // Print "M3" to the console
        }
    }

    // Main method - entry point of the program
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Good Morning"); // Print "Good Morning" to the console
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `class Temp2`
   - This line defines a class named `Temp2`.

3. `static void M1()`
   - This line defines a static method named `M1`. It does not return any value.

4. `for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)`
   - This line starts a for loop that iterates from 0 to 5 (inclusive), resulting in 6 iterations.

5. `Console.WriteLine("M1");`
   - This line prints "M1" to the console during each iteration of the loop in method `M1`.

6. The same structure is repeated for methods `M2` and `M3`, which print "M2" and "M3" respectively.

7. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

8. Inside the `Main` method, a for loop is used to print "Good Morning" to the console six times.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates the use of methods and loops. It defines three methods (`M1`, `M2`, and `M3`) that print different messages to the console. The `Main` method serves as the entry point of the program and prints "Good Morning" six times.

When executed, the output will be:
Good Morning 
Good Morning 
Good Morning 
Good Morning 
Good Morning 
Good Morning

The methods `M1`, `M2`, and `M3` are defined but not called in the `Main` method, so their output will not be displayed unless they are invoked within `Main`.
