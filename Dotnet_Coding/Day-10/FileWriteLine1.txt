"Creating a File and Writing Text Using StreamWriter in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates how to create a file and write text to it using the `StreamWriter` class.

Code:

using System;
using System.IO;

class Temp5
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string path = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\sai"; // Specify the path to the file to be created

        // Create a StreamWriter to write to the specified file
        using (StreamWriter w1 = new StreamWriter(path))
        {
            w1.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); // Write a line of text to the file
        }

        Console.WriteLine("File created and text copied successfully"); // Indicate that the operation was successful
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.IO;`
   - This line includes the System.IO namespace, which contains classes for handling input and output, including file operations.

3. `class Temp5`
   - This line defines a class named `Temp5`.

4. `public static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `string path = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\sai";`
   - This line specifies the path to the file that will be created. Ensure that this path is valid and that you have permission to write to this location.

6. `using (StreamWriter w1 = new StreamWriter(path))`
   - This line creates a new instance of `StreamWriter` to write to the specified file. The `using` statement ensures that the `StreamWriter` is properly disposed of after use, which also closes the file.

7. `w1.WriteLine("Hello, World!");`
   - This line writes the string "Hello, World!" to the file, followed by a newline character.

8. `Console.WriteLine("File created and text copied successfully");`
   - This line prints a message to the console indicating that the file has been successfully created and the text has been written to it.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a file and write text to it using the `StreamWriter` class. The program specifies a file path, writes a line of text to the file, and indicates when the operation is complete.

When executed, if the specified file is created successfully, the output will be:
File created and text copied successfully

If the file cannot be created due to permission issues or an invalid path, an exception will be thrown, and the program will terminate with an error message.
