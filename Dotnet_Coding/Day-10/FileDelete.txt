"Checking for a File's Existence and Deleting It in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates how to check if a file exists and delete it if it does.

Code:

using System;
using System.IO;

class Temp5
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // string source = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\mohansai"; // Source path (commented out)
        string dest = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\mohans.txt"; // Specify the destination file path

        // Check if the file exists
        if (File.Exists(dest))
        {
            File.Delete(dest); // Delete the file if it exists
            Console.WriteLine("Done success"); // Indicate that the file has been deleted
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File not existed"); // Indicate that the file does not exist
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.IO;`
   - This line includes the System.IO namespace, which contains classes for handling input and output, including file operations.

3. `class Temp5`
   - This line defines a class named `Temp5`.

4. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `string dest = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\mohans.txt";`
   - This line specifies the path to the file that will be checked for existence and potentially deleted.

6. `if (File.Exists(dest))`
   - This line checks if the file specified by `dest` exists.

7. `File.Delete(dest);`
   - If the file exists, this line deletes the file.

8. `Console.WriteLine("Done success");`
   - This line prints a message to the console indicating that the file has been successfully deleted.

9. `else`
   - This line begins the alternative block that executes if the file does not exist.

10. `Console.WriteLine("File not existed");`
    - This line prints a message to the console indicating that the file does not exist.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to check for the existence of a file and delete it if it exists. The program specifies a file path, checks if the file exists, and performs the deletion if applicable, providing feedback to the user.

When executed, if the specified file exists and is successfully deleted, the output will be:
Done success

If the file does not exist, the output will be:
File not existed
