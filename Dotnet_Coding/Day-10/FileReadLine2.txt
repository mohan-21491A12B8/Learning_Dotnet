"Reading Lines from Two Files Simultaneously Using StreamReader in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates how to read lines from two text files simultaneously using the `StreamReader` class.

Code:

using System;
using System.IO;

class Temp6
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string path1 = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\mohansai"; // Specify the path to the first text file
        string path2 = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\mohans"; // Specify the path to the second text file

        // Create StreamReaders to read from both specified files
        using (StreamReader w1 = new StreamReader(path1))
        using (StreamReader w2 = new StreamReader(path2))
        {
            string line1, line2; // Variables to hold each line read from the files

            // Read lines from both files until the end of either file is reached
            while ((line1 = w1.ReadLine()) != null && (line2 = w2.ReadLine()) != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("hi"); // Print a message for each pair of lines read
                Console.WriteLine("welcome"); // Print another message
            }
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Execution completed"); // Indicate that the operation was successful
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.IO;`
   - This line includes the System.IO namespace, which contains classes for handling input and output, including file operations.

3. `class Temp6`
   - This line defines a class named `Temp6`.

4. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `string path1 = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\mohansai";`
   - This line specifies the path to the first text file that will be read. Ensure that this path points to an existing file.

6. `string path2 = "C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\mohans";`
   - This line specifies the path to the second text file that will be read. Ensure that this path points to an existing file.

7. `using (StreamReader w1 = new StreamReader(path1))`
   - This line creates a new instance of `StreamReader` to read from the first specified file.

8. `using (StreamReader w2 = new StreamReader(path2))`
   - This line creates a new instance of `StreamReader` to read from the second specified file.

9. `string line1, line2;`
   - This line declares variables to hold each line read from the respective files.

10. `while ((line1 = w1.ReadLine()) != null && (line2 = w2.ReadLine()) != null)`
    - This line reads lines from both files simultaneously until the end of either file is reached. The loop continues as long as both `ReadLine` calls return non-null values.

11. `Console.WriteLine("hi");`
    - This line prints "hi" to the console for each pair of lines read from the files.

12. `Console.WriteLine("welcome");`
    - This line prints "welcome" to the console for each pair of lines read from the files.

13. `Console.WriteLine("Execution completed");`
    - This line prints a message to the console indicating that the operation has completed.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to read lines from two text files simultaneously using the `StreamReader` class. The program specifies two file paths, reads lines from both files in pairs, and prints messages to the console. It indicates when the execution is completed.

When executed, if both specified files exist and are read successfully, the output will be:
hi welcome ... Execution completed

If either file does not exist or another error occurs, an exception will be thrown, and the program will terminate with an error message.
