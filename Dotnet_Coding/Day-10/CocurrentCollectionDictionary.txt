C# Program Explanation

"Using ConcurrentDictionary in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the creation and usage of a `ConcurrentDictionary` to store key-value pairs in a thread-safe manner, allowing for concurrent additions and updates.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Temp
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a ConcurrentDictionary
        ConcurrentDictionary<int, string> dictionary = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, string>();

        // Parallel add/update entries
        Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>
        {
            // Add a key-value pair
            bool added = dictionary.TryAdd(i, $"Value {i}");

            // If already exists, update the value
            if (!added)
            {
                dictionary[i] = $"Updated Value {i}";
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"Thread {Task.CurrentId}: Key = {i}, Value = {dictionary[i]}");
        });

        Console.WriteLine("\nContents of ConcurrentDictionary:");
        foreach (var pair in dictionary)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Key = {pair.Key}, Value = {pair.Value}");
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Concurrent;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Concurrent namespace, which contains classes for concurrent collections, including ConcurrentDictionary.

3. `using System.Threading.Tasks;`
   - This line includes the System.Threading.Tasks namespace, which provides classes for parallel programming.

4. `class Temp`
   - This line defines a class named `Temp`.

5. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

6. `ConcurrentDictionary<int, string> dictionary = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, string>();`
   - This line initializes a new `ConcurrentDictionary` that will store integer keys and string values.

7. `Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>`
   - This line starts a parallel loop that iterates from 0 to 9, allowing multiple threads to execute the loop body concurrently.

8. `bool added = dictionary.TryAdd(i, $"Value {i}");`
   - This line attempts to add a key-value pair to the dictionary. If the key already exists, it returns false.

9. `if (!added)`
   - This line checks if the addition was unsuccessful (i.e., the key already exists).

10. `dictionary[i] = $"Updated Value {i}";`
    - This line updates the value for the existing key in the dictionary.

11. `Console.WriteLine($"Thread {Task.CurrentId}: Key = {i}, Value = {dictionary[i]}");`
    - This line prints the current thread ID, the key, and the corresponding value in the dictionary.

12. `Console.WriteLine("\nContents of ConcurrentDictionary:");`
    - This line prints a message indicating that the contents of the dictionary will be displayed.

13. `foreach (var pair in dictionary)`
    - This line starts a loop that iterates through each key-value pair in the `ConcurrentDictionary`.

14. `Console.WriteLine($"Key = {pair.Key}, Value = {pair.Value}");`
    - This line prints each key-value pair in the dictionary.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a `ConcurrentDictionary`, add key-value pairs concurrently, and update existing entries in a thread-safe manner. The program initializes a `ConcurrentDictionary` with integer keys and string values, performs parallel additions and updates, and displays the contents of the dictionary at the end.

When executed, the program will output something similar to:
Thread 1: Key = 0, Value = Value 0
Thread 1: Key = 1, Value = Value 1
Thread 2: Key = 2, Value = Value 2
Thread 2: Key = 3, Value = Value 3
Thread 3: Key = 4, Value = Value 4
Thread 3: Key = 5, Value = Value 5
Thread 4: Key = 6, Value = Value 6
Thread 4: Key = 7, Value = Value 7
Thread 5: Key = 8, Value = Value 8
Thread 5: Key = 9, Value = Value 9

Contents of ConcurrentDictionary: Key = 0, Value = Value 0 Key = 1, Value = Value 1 Key = 2, Value = Value 2 Key = 3, Value = Value 3 Key = 4, Value = Value 4 Key = 5, Value = Value 5 Key = 6, Value = Value 6 Key = 7, Value = Value 7 Key = 8, Value = Value 8 Key = 9, Value = Value 9

The results of the concurrent operations performed on the `ConcurrentDictionary`, including the key-value pairs added or updated by different threads. Each thread's ID is displayed alongside the key and its corresponding value, demonstrating the thread-safe nature of the `ConcurrentDictionary`. The final contents of the dictionary confirm that all keys from 0 to 9 have been successfully added with their respective values.
