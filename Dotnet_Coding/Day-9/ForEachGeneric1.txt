C# Program Explanation

"Using List in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the creation and usage of a List to store integers and how to iterate through it.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class ListExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<int> list = new List<int>(); // Create a new List of integers
        list.Add(1); // Add the integer 1 to the list

        foreach (int i in list) // Iterate through each integer in the list
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i); // Print the current integer
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Generic;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which contains generic collections such as List.

3. `class ListExample`
   - This line defines a class named `ListExample`.

4. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `List<int> list = new List<int>();`
   - This line initializes a new List that will store integers.

6. `list.Add(1);`
   - This line adds the integer 1 to the List.

7. `foreach (int i in list)`
   - This line starts a loop that iterates through each integer in the List.

8. `Console.WriteLine(i);`
   - This line prints the current integer (`i`) to the console.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a List of integers, add an integer to it, and iterate through its elements to display them. The program initializes a List, adds the integer 1, and prints each element in the List.

When executed, the program will output:
1

This output shows the integer 1 printed on a new line.
