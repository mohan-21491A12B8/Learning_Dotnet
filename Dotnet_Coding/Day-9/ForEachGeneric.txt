C# Program Explanation

"Using List and Foreach in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the creation and usage of a List and how to iterate through it using a foreach loop.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Sample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<string> s1 = new List<string> { "red", "yellow", "orange" }; // Initialize a List of strings
        foreach (string i1 in s1) // Iterate through each string in the List
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i1); // Print the current string
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Generic;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which contains generic collections such as List.

3. `class Sample`
   - This line defines a class named `Sample`.

4. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `List<string> s1 = new List<string> { "red", "yellow", "orange" };`
   - This line initializes a new List of strings containing the elements "red", "yellow", and "orange".

6. `foreach (string i1 in s1)`
   - This line starts a loop that iterates through each string in the List `s1`.

7. `Console.WriteLine(i1);`
   - This line prints the current string (`i1`) to the console.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a List of strings and iterate through its elements using a foreach loop. The program initializes a List with three string elements and prints each element to the console.

When executed, the program will output:
red yellow orange

This output shows each element of the List printed on a new line.
