"Printing a 5x5 Star Pattern"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates how to print a 5x5 grid of stars using nested loops.

Code:

using System;

class ForEach
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) // Outer loop for rows
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) // Inner loop for columns
            {
                Console.Write("*"); // Print a star
            }
            Console.WriteLine(); // Move to the next line after printing stars in a row
        }
        Console.ReadKey(true); // Wait for a key press before closing
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which provides fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `class ForEach`
   - This line defines a class named `ForEach`.

3. `static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

4. `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)`
   - This outer loop iterates five times, representing the five rows of the star pattern.

5. `for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++)`
   - This inner loop also iterates five times for each row, responsible for printing five stars in that row.

6. `Console.Write("*");`
   - This line prints a star without moving to a new line.

7. `Console.WriteLine();`
   - After the inner loop completes, this line moves the cursor to the next line, preparing for the next row of stars.

8. `Console.ReadKey(true);`
   - This line pauses the program until a key is pressed, allowing the user to see the output before the console window closes.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a 5x5 grid of stars using nested loops. The program initializes two loops: the outer loop for rows and the inner loop for columns. Each iteration of the inner loop prints a star, and after completing a row, the program moves to the next line.

When executed, the program will output:
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****

This output consists of five rows, each containing five stars, forming a square pattern.
