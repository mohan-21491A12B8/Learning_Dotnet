C# Program Explanation

"Using LinkedList in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates the creation and usage of a LinkedList.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Collect1
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        LinkedList<int> l1 = new LinkedList<int>(); // Create a new LinkedList of integers
        l1.AddLast(10); // Add elements to the LinkedList
        l1.AddLast(20);
        l1.AddLast(30);
        l1.AddLast(40);
        l1.AddLast(50);
        l1.AddLast(60);
        
        foreach (int a in l1) // Iterate through the LinkedList
        {
            Console.Write(a + "->"); // Print each element followed by an arrow
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Generic;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which contains generic collections such as LinkedList.

3. `class Collect1`
   - This line defines a class named `Collect1`.

4. `public static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

5. `LinkedList<int> l1 = new LinkedList<int>();`
   - This line initializes a new LinkedList that will store integers.

6. `l1.AddLast(value);`
   - This method adds integers to the end of the LinkedList. In this case, the values 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 are added sequentially.

7. `foreach (int a in l1)`
   - This line starts a loop that iterates through each integer in the LinkedList.

8. `Console.Write(a + "->");`
   - This line prints each integer followed by an arrow, resulting in the output: `10->20->30->40->50->60->`.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to create a LinkedList, add elements to it, and iterate through the elements to display them. The use of `LinkedList<T>` allows for efficient insertion and traversal of elements, showcasing the flexibility of linked lists compared to arrays.

When executed, the program will output:
10->20->30->40->50->60->

This output shows the elements of the LinkedList printed in the order they were added, followed by arrows indicating the sequence.
