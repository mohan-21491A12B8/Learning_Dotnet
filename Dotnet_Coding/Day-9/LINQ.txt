C# Program Explanation

"Using LINQ with List in C#"

This document explains a C# program that demonstrates how to filter a List of strings using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to find elements that start with a specific character.

Code:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Sample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        List<string> s1 = new List<string> { "red", "yellow", "green", "white" }; // Initialize a List of strings
        var s2 = s1.Where(n => n.StartsWith("y")); // Use LINQ to filter strings that start with "y"
        foreach (var x in s2) // Iterate through the filtered results
        {
            Console.WriteLine(x); // Print each filtered string
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. `using System;`
   - This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes for commonly used types.

2. `using System.Collections.Generic;`
   - This line includes the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which contains generic collections such as List.

3. `using System.Linq;`
   - This line includes the System.Linq namespace, which provides classes and methods for querying collections.

4. `class Sample`
   - This line defines a class named `Sample`.

5. `public static void Main()`
   - This line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

6. `List<string> s1 = new List<string> { "red", "yellow", "green", "white" };`
   - This line initializes a new List of strings containing the elements "red", "yellow", "green", and "white".

7. `var s2 = s1.Where(n => n.StartsWith("y"));`
   - This line uses LINQ to filter the List `s1`, creating a new collection `s2` that contains only the strings that start with the letter "y".

8. `foreach (var x in s2)`
   - This line starts a loop that iterates through each string in the filtered collection `s2`.

9. `Console.WriteLine(x);`
   - This line prints each filtered string to the console.

Summary:
This C# program demonstrates how to use LINQ to filter a List of strings based on a condition. The program initializes a List with four color names and filters the List to find strings that start with the letter "y". It then prints the filtered results.

When executed, the program will output:

yellow

This output shows the string "yellow", which is the only element in the List that starts with the letter "y".
