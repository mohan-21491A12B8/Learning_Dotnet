## Features

- Sample applications demonstrating .NET concepts
- Tutorials on C# programming
- Guides for ASP.NET development
- Best practices and coding standards

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET 9.0.202
- ASP.NET (if applicable)

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohan-21491A12B8/Learning_Dotnet.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Learning_Dotnet
   ```

## Compiling and Running the Program

### Using `csc`

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your C# file (e.g., `Program1.cs`).
3. Compile the program using the C# compiler:
   ```bash
   csc Program1.cs
   ```
   This will generate an executable file named `Program1.exe`.

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   Program1.exe
   ```

### Using Visual Studio

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Open the project or solution containing your C# file.
3. Build the project by clicking on **Build > Build Solution** or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`.
4. Run the program by clicking on the **Start** button (green arrow) or pressing `F5`.

### Using Visual Studio Terminal

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Open the integrated terminal by going to **View > Terminal** or pressing `` Ctrl + ` `` (backtick).
3. Navigate to the directory containing your C# file (if necessary).
4. Compile the program using the C# compiler:
   ```bash
   csc Program1.cs
   ```
5. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   Program1.exe
   ```

### Example Output

When you run the application, you will see the following output in the console:

```
Hello, World!
```
